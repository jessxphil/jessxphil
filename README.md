### Hi, I'm Jessica Phillip 👋

<!--
**jessxphil/jessxphil** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. --> 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on an ai-based startup. 
- 🌱 These days, I'm deep diving into the world of GNNs, tinkering with neural networks, building recommendation systems, and gathering best practices of machine learning in production.
- 🤔 I’m looking to meet more machine learning engineers in the greater Atlanta or Alpharetta area! Let's link up!
